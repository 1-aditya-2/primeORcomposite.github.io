        <h1>Prime or Composite</h1>
        <p>
             Prime and composite numbers are the two types of numbers,
             that differ based on the number of factors they have. 
             A prime number is the one that has only two factors and 
             a composite number has more than two factors. A factor 
             is a value, that can divide a number or an expression evenly.
             In this lesson, the properties of prime numbers and 
             composite numbers are given along with their difference,
             examples and tables. The chart of prime and composite numbers,
             given in this article, will help to identify them easily.

             <b style="color:burlywood;">What are Prime Numbers and Composite Numbers?</b><br>
             A prime number is a number which has exactly two factors i.e.
             1 and the number itself. A composite number has more than two 
             factors, which means apart from getting divided by 1 and the 
             number itself, it can also be divided by at least one positive 
             integer. 1 is not a prime or composite number. Apart from these
             two, there is also a similar category of numbers which are coprime 
             numbers. A detailed explanation of these numbers is given below.<br><br>
             <b style="color:burlywood">Prime Numbers</b><br>
             A prime number is the one which has exactly two factors, which means,
              it can be divided by only “1” and itself. But “1” is not a prime number.<br>

             Example of Prime Number<br>

             3 is a prime number because 3 can be divided by only two number’s i.e. 1 and 3 itself.
            In the same way, 2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 are prime numbers.<br><br>

             <b style="color:burlywood;">Composite Numbers</b><br>
                A composite number has more than two factors, which means apart from getting 
                divided by the number 1 and itself, it can also be divided by at least one 
                integer or number. We don’t consider ‘1’ as a composite number.

               <br> Example of Composite Number<br>

                12 is a composite number because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. 
                So, the number ‘12’ has 6 factors.
